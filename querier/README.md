Rodrigo Vega Ayllon reva5

Implemented all subsets of functionality.

Note: I acknowledge that, on the test case with valgrind, there is a memory error that says: "Invalid [read/write] of size x".

Another note: Git could not open 'test3\_dir' or 'unreadable', which are test files, since they are read-only, so that is why they are not in my repo, but grader can implement them themselves.
